Many online services are provided free of charge and this is achieved by monetising the personal information that these sites collect on users where the product being traded is  personal  information. The  recent  increase  in  data  misuse  on  large  social  media sites has cause for questioning our current model of gathering user data and has raised privacy concerns regarding the amounts and type of data being gathered. In this paper, we research a model on which users would have control over the data they share and are rewarded for sharing there personal information.  Personal information in this case is information gathered on the user and the intellectual property of the user.This is achieved through a blog built on blockchain.The blog built on blockchain would provide a method for users to retain control over their data and maintain accountability of who has access to this data.  The two technologies that make this possible are Ethereum and IPFS. Ethereum acts as the backend of the project and IPFS is used for the storage and retrieval of blogs and user data.This project feels that user should be rewarded for their data and contributions to the site and this is achieved through using the blockchain tokens. The users have the option to exchange their data for tokens. These tokens can then be used to pay for transactionson the  blockchain such as posting new blogs, or even for supporting blogs that they enjoy. This would allow the community to decide what they feel the worth of a blog is and be valued for their data.
